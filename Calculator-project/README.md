# Create a Web Application usingÂ Django

In this project we'll create a calculator web application on Django web framework that will perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The front-end of this application will allow the users to enter two operands and the backend will calculate the result based on the chosen operation and send that to the front-end.
